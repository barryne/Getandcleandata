Source of the original data is: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip . The description of the original data is found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
The attached R script (run_analysis.R) performs the following to clean up the data:
	•	1. Reads the datasets: training, test, activity, features and subject
		"X_train.txt"
		"y_train.txt"
		"X_test.txt"
		"y_test.txt"
		"subject_train.txt"
		"subject_test.txt"
		"activity_labels.txt"
		"features.txt"
	•	2. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set for each of X, y, and subject.

•	3. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names:

"actid", "activitytype" for the activity dataset
"featid", "featuretype" for the features dataset
"subjectid" for the subject dataset
feature type names for each feature instance in the X dataset
"activity" for the y dataset

•	4. Extracts only the feature measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

	•	5. Reads activity_labels.txt and applies descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set and reformats as:
laying
sitting
standing
walking
walkingdownstairs
walkingupstairs

	•	6. Merges the cleaned datasets into one dataset
	•	7. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
	•	8. Create and writes to working directory a long format tidy dataset, the resulting dataset has four variables:
“activity” string as described above
“subjected” integer which indicates 1 of 30 subjects who participated in the study
“feature” string which is a list of 66 recorded features of the study which are mean or standard deviation measures
“mean” numeric which is the metric captured for the observed subject:activity:feature combination
